# Installation

To install Zustand Storage, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 18.0 or above) installed. Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install zustand-storage
```

Or, if you prefer pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add zustand-storage
```

This command installs the Zustand Storage package, allowing you to integrate state persistence and synchronization into your React application.
