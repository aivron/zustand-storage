‚ö°Ô∏è **Zustand Storage** helps you manage your application state effortlessly with a powerful API and automatic persistence‚Äîall built with React in mind.

üí∏ Building a robust state management solution from scratch can be challenging. Instead, **focus on your app‚Äôs core features** while Zustand Storage takes care of state synchronization, local persistence, and even database integration.

üí• Ready for more? With advanced features like configurable merge strategies, debounce persistence, middleware support, and optional direct integration with databases such as MongoDB and PostgreSQL, Zustand Storage scales with your project‚Äôs needs.

## Fast Track ‚è±Ô∏è {#fast-track}

Learn Zustand Storage in **5 minutes** by following this quick tutorial.

### Installation

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 18.0 or above) and add Zustand Storage to your project:

```bash
npm install zustand-storage
```

Or with pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add zustand-storage
```

### Create Your Synced Store

Create a new file (e.g., `store.ts`) and set up your synced store:

```ts
import { createSyncedStore } from 'zustand-storage';

interface AppState {
  count: number;
}

const store = createSyncedStore<AppState, { increment: () => void }>({
  key: 'app-state',
  initialState: { count: 0 },
  actions: (set, get) => ({
    increment: () => set({ count: get().count + 1 }),
  }),
  syncOptions: {
    debounce: 300,
    persistOn: 'change',
    onError: (error) => console.error("Sync error:", error),
  },
  mergeStrategy: 'deep',
});

export default store;
```

### Using the Store in Your Application

Integrate the store in your React components using the provided hook:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useStore } from 'zustand-storage';

function Counter() {
  const [state, actions] = useStore();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={actions.increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```
